# Lane

Lane is a small utility package which checks if selected webpage contains one or more keywords.
It can run in the background periodically checking in for a match and notifying you when that occurs. E.g. you are waiting for a website to publish a certain article, so instead of checking every now and then you can use this script to do it for you.

It can be used from the command line or as a module.
